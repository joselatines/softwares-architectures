# Hexagonal Architecture in Express.js

This project demonstrates the implementation of Hexagonal Architecture in an Express.js application. Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters or Onion Architecture, is a software design pattern that promotes maintainability, flexibility, and separation of concerns.

## Features
- Hexagonal Architecture: The core of the application is structured following the principles of Hexagonal Architecture, with clear separation of business logic and external dependencies.
- Express.js Framework: The application utilizes Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests and manage the web layer.
- SQLite Database: Database operations are handled using SQLite, a lightweight and serverless relational database engine.

## Run the application:
`npm install` 
`npm start`
